>Storytelling is Everywhere

My name is Jessica Janiszewski. I am an artist and designer from Virginia.
I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Savannah College of Art and Design in Sequential Arts and Animation. I am currently pursuing my graduate degree in Graphic Information Technology at Arizona State University.

I hope to combine my knowledge of visual arts with the coding that I am learning as a student in order to create captivating web applications. It is my goal to tell a story through every project I make.

Aside from arts and crafts, I enjoy playing video games in my spare time.
